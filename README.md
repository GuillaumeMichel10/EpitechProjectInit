# Epitech Project Initialization

This script automates the initialization of an Epitech project by creating the project directory, downloading common `.gitignore` templates, and copying necessary scripts.

## Usage

```bash
./init_project.sh <project_name> <project_path>
```

<project_name>: The name of your project.
<project_path>: The path where you want to create the project.

## Example

./init_project.sh MyEpitechProject ~/projects
```
